00_Overview.pdf depicts the relationships between the python scripts. In the filder 00_saved_variables are some small sample data sets to facilitate the understanding of the codes. Furthermore, a Jupyter Notebook is provided in this folder as well, which coveres the same codes as explained in 00_Overview.pdf with a few explanations.

The input/output data set in .txt format for the MLP training, testing and validation can be obtained [here](https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdataverse.harvard.edu%2Fdataset.xhtml%3FpersistentId%3Ddoi%3A10.7910%2FDVN%2FT46ANR&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cmarie-amelie.boucher%40usherbrooke.ca%7C15c6928147524d7954c608d87c1df1af%7C3a5a8744593545f99423b32c3a5de082%7C0%7C0%7C637395815355934392%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=QqAFel6%2B6KxaVr6fM53mLH0qXg06BhubaoXsfc%2FJIyI%3D&amp;reserved=0). This data does not include used data from partners, which do not allow to publish their data. However, 98% of the used data can be handed out.
