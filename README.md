## Codes for the Article 'Using an ensemble of artificial neural networks to convert snow depth to snow water equivalent over Canada'

00_Overview.pdf depicts the relationships between the python scripts. In the filder 00_saved_variables are some small sample data sets to facilitate the understanding of the codes. 

The used data set in txt format can be obtained by writing the auther (konstantin.ntokas@yahoo.de). This data does not include used data from partners, which do not allow to publish their data. However, 98% of the used data can be handed out. Furthermore, a Jupyter Notebook will be found within the data folder, which coveres the same codes as in this repository with a few explanations and uses the used data set directly.
