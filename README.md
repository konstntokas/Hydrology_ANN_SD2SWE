The Jupyter Notebook 'Documentation.ipynb' shows a summary of the project including preparation fo the data, training of the ANN, training evaluation and simulation and evaluation on unseen dataset. 

For better code viewing, the 00_Overview.pdf depicts the relationship between the python scripts.

The available data does not include used data from partners, whcih do not allow to publish their data. However, 98% of the used data is public and available here (Link) To used the python scripts, one need to create a folder 00_saved_variables and store the data in their.
